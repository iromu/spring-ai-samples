# MCP GraphQL Server

The MCP GraphQL Server is a backend service that processes GraphQL schemas to dynamically register tools within an MCP (
Model Context Protocol) ecosystem. It enables the execution of GraphQL queries defined in the provided schemas,
efficiently exposing GraphQL APIs as interoperable tools for AI, workflow orchestration, or other automated systems.

## Key Features

- **Schema-Driven Tool Registration**: Parses provided GraphQL schemas and registers operations as callable tools inside
  the MCP system.
- **Query Execution**: Accepts, validates, and runs GraphQL queries against the registered schemas.
- **Interoperability**: Integrates into MCP-compatible environments, allowing low-code or AI-driven clients to discover
  and invoke GraphQL-based tools without manual API wiring.

## Typical Flow

1. **GraphQL schemas** are provided to the server.
2. **Server parses and registers** queries and mutations as individual callable tools.
3. **Clients or workflows** within the MCP environment can discover and execute these tools using standard MCP
   protocols.

## Use Cases

- Expose existing GraphQL APIs for orchestration or automation tools.
- Allow AI agents to reason over, discover, and invoke API operations via MCP.
- Integrate heterogeneous GraphQL backends into unified tool/plugin catalogs.
